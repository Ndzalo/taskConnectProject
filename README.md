Due to some technical challenges, we encountered difficulties pushing our work to GitHub as initially planned. As a result, we had to manually combine our contributions before submission. We acknowledge this setback and have learned from the experience to improve our collaboration and version control in future projects. the first git repo that was used(https://github.com/Teddylikeabear/TaskConnect)
